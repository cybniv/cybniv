### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

you can check my website to see what I'm currently working on or to find ways to contact me.

As you already began reading at this point, you may as well enjoy some of my favorite quotes from Linus Torvalds:

> Software is like sex, it's better when it's free.

> If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, youâ€™re screwed anyway, and should fix your program.

> Those that can, do. Those that can't, complain.

> Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done.

> Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.
